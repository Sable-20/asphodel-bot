## Disclaimer
<strong>This project is still quite fresh in creation, and things will come and go.</strong> There is absolutely nothing yet in this repository, and for the next couple commits or pushes, it will be just the base code for the Discord bot and very sudden change of plans.

This Readme will most likely be updated as soon as it needs an update, and more sections and documentation will be made as soon as the planned features are ready.


## About this Project's Branch
The <strong>Asphodel</strong> `slash` branch contains a variant of the Discord Bot that is designed to accept and execute Discord's newly added feature, the <strong>Slash Commands.</strong> Overall, nothing's fairly new. It's still the same Discord Moderation Bot for servers to use, and it still aims to do most of the things over the top.

The idea of creating this bra
<br/>
<br/>
The project relies on the [Discord.JS](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/) module for Node.js.<br/>
Most of the command handling is done by the [WOKCommands](https://github.com/AlexzanderFlores/WOKCommands) module.


## Changelog & Roadmap
I'm fairly sure I still have to properly handle versioning on this project. Things are going to be chaotic, like the disclaimer says:
> *"...things will come and go."*
<strong>Assume that every changes made will be for v0.1.0 unless stated otherwise.</strong>
