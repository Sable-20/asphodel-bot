## Disclaimer
<strong>This project is still quite fresh in creation, and things will come and go.</strong> There is absolutely nothing yet in this repository, and for the next couple commits or pushes, it will be just the base code for the Discord bot and very sudden change of plans.

This Readme will most likely be updated as soon as it needs an update, and more sections and documentation will be made as soon as the planned features are ready.


## About this Project
The <strong>Asphodel</strong> bot is a Discord Bot project designed and created by Marcoroni (salty-sweet). It is mainly a Discord Moderation Bot for servers and it aims to do most of the things over the top.

The idea of creating this bot comes from the sudden pressure of trying to make a project to put on his own Github profile, primarily to make it look good.
<br/>
<br/>
Asphodel's <i>[soon to be]</i> implemented core features are the following:
  - [ ] Over-the-top Server Moderation commands
  - [ ] Userdata Change Logging
  - [ ] Role Handling through Reactions
  - [ ] Over-the-top Fun/Entertainment commands
  - [ ] Bot Logging in a specified channels
  - [ ] Salty's Pack of Goodies
  - [ ] Sentience and Consciousness

...and many more to be planned in the future!
<br/>
<br/>
The project relies on the [Discord.JS](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/) module for Node.js.
